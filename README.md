UNDatathon by DJeANS (DeJAS)

In this event, we have utilized data from various sources to analyze and predict bushfires and their potential impact on endangered species and flaged certain regions which lack fire prevention resources.

Our analysis relies on data obtained from the following sources:

NPWS Fire History - Wildfires and Prescribed Burns:

Data Source: NPWS Fire History
Description: This dataset provides valuable information about the history of wildfires and prescribed burns, offering insights into historical fire occurrences.
https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/fire-history-wildfires-and-prescribed-burns-1e8b6 

Data Source: CPC - Climate Prediction Center https://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/cadb_v2/daily/ 
Description: daily data obtained from the Climate Prediction Center. This data helps us in forecasting and understanding the dynamics of bushfires. 

Hosting the Open-Sourced R-Shiny App:
As part of our efforts, we have developed an open-source R-Shiny application that integrates geospatial data related to bushfires, fire stations, and endangered species. The primary objective of this application is to highlight regions at high risk of wildfires and are habitat of endangered species.
