UNDatathon by DJeANS (DeJAS)

In this event, we have utilized data from various sources to analyze and predict bushfires and their potential impact on endangered species and flaged certain regions which lack fire prevention resources.

Our analysis relies on data obtained from the following sources:

NPWS Fire History - Wildfires and Prescribed Burns:

Data Source: NPWS Fire History
Description: This dataset provides valuable information about the history of wildfires and prescribed burns, offering insights into historical fire occurrences.
Daily Data for Bush Fire Prediction (Climate Prediction Center - CPC):

Data Source: CPC - Climate Prediction Center
Description: Our predictions and analyses are based on daily data obtained from the Climate Prediction Center. This data helps us in forecasting and understanding the dynamics of bushfires.
Hosting the Open-Sourced R-Shiny App:
As part of our efforts, we have developed an open-source R-Shiny application that integrates geospatial data related to bushfires, fire stations, and endangered species. The primary objective of this application is to highlight regions at high risk of wildfires and provide insights into the habitat of endangered species.

This R-Shiny app brings together the following essential datasets:

Latest Bush Fire Cases: Real-time data on the latest bushfire incidents.
Fire Stations: The locations of fire stations for emergency response and coordination.
Endangered Species: Information about the habitats of endangered species.
Through the R-Shiny app, we aim to visualize and analyze these datasets to make informed decisions and take proactive steps in mitigating the impact of wildfires on both the environment and communities. Our app provides an interactive platform for users to explore and understand the data, helping us move toward a safer and more sustainable future.
