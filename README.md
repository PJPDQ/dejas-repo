# UNDatathon by DJeANS (DeJAS)

In this event, we have utilized data from various sources to analyze and predict bushfires and their potential impact on endangered species and flaged certain regions which lack fire prevention resources.

### Story Map : https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e038ffe87aa44c01ad2a43ec6eb843bc 

## Our analysis relies on data obtained from the following sources:

### Fire History - Wildfires
#### Data Source: NPWS Fire History https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/fire-history-wildfires-and-prescribed-burns-1e8b6 
#### Description: This dataset provides valuable information about the history of wildfires and prescribed burns, offering insights into historical fire occurrences.


### Climate Data
#### Data Source: CPC - Climate Prediction Center  https://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/cadb_v2/daily/ 
#### Description: daily data obtained from the Climate Prediction Center. This data helps us in forecasting and understanding the dynamics of bushfires. 

### Threatened Species 
#### Data Source: https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download
#### Description: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Speciesâ„¢ contains global assessments for more than 150,300 species. More than 82% of these (>123,600 species) have spatial data.
#### Note: So far in our R-shiny App, we only integrated Mammals and Reptiles.

### Fire Station Data
#### Data Source: Fire and Rescue NSW (FRNSW) https://www.fire.nsw.gov.au/ 
#### Description: This data provide us with the number of fire station in NSW. More details of the extraction https://github.com/PJPDQ/dejas-repo/blob/main/fire_station_fetcher.ipynb 


### Hosting the Open-Sourced R-Shiny App:
As part of our efforts, we have developed an open-source R-Shiny application that integrates geospatial data related to bushfires, fire stations, and endangered species. The primary objective of this application is to highlight regions at high risk of wildfires and are habitat of endangered species.
